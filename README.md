# PADD---No-Internet-check
When you launch the offical PADD for PI-Hole it requests google.com to check if you are connected, this version not.

I just changed some lines of code, the official project is under https://github.com/jpmck/PADD !

# How should I install that (This is a slightly changed version of the official one)?

    Get a copy of PADD--No-Internet-check by running:


wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jannik169/PADD---No-Internet-check/master/paddnic.sh

    Make PADD executable by running

sudo chmod +x padd-nic.sh

    And now you can run it.

./padd-nic.sh
